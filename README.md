# 🩺 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a **Streamlit web app** that predicts medical insurance costs based on user inputs like age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children.
The app compares predictions from **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models to provide transparent and accurate estimates.
