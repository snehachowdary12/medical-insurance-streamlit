# 🩺 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a **Streamlit web app** that predicts **medical insurance costs** based on user inputs such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children.  
The project uses **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** models to compare and predict premium prices.  
It aims to provide transparent and accurate health insurance cost estimation using **Machine Learning**.

## 🧠 About the Project
Healthcare costs can be difficult to estimate. This project uses machine learning models to predict insurance premiums using common patient features and demographics.  
By comparing multiple models, it ensures both **accuracy** and **transparency** in cost prediction.

This app is built with:
- Python 🐍  
- Streamlit 🎈  
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

---

## ⚙️ Features
✅ User-friendly Streamlit interface  
✅ Real-time insurance premium prediction  
✅ Comparison between 3 machine learning models  
✅ Uses real dataset for accurate results  
✅ Easy to deploy and share online
